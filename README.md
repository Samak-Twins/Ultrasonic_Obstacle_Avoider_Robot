# Ultrasonic_Obstacle_Avoider_Robot
The "Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoider Robot" uses Ultrasonic Sensor to detect obstacles, the data is then processed by Arduino and ultimately, the robot avoids the obstacle successfully.  This robotics project won the First Prize at "TechKnow 2017 (Second Edition)", a physics concept based project demonstration competition at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.
